I'm not much of a stickler for contribution guidelines, but please just make sure that your code is readable and formatted with, PREFERABLY, stylua. Also, please make sure to test anything that you have changed and verify that everything is working as expected.

Some features that I would like to see:

- [ ] Save the history across sessions for the CWD (possible resession.nvim integration?)
